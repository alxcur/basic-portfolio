            I am an artist, graphic designer, and art director residing Dallas Texas. I currently make art and live live in Oak Cliff with my two cats. The first sixteen years of my life were in Farmersville Texas. I graduated  from Texas Christian University in Fort Worth Texas with a BFA in Graphic Design in 2010. The majority of my work experience has been within the Dallas art scene and freelance jobs. My work derives from found objects, DYI aesthetic, trash art, and creative collaborations. The rawness of my work mirrors her constant self-evolution. I plan to expand my knowledge of code this Fall at Southern Methodist University.</p>
